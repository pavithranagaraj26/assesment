### Challenge 1
Created a three tier arch deployment using GCP services primarily with GKE, sample python app, cloudsql. 

To provision these resources here I have used terraform and for CICD pipeline have created a pipeline file.

Can also the run the code manually using  
 - `terraform int`
 - `terraform plan`
 - `terraform apply`
 - `terraform destroy`

Also can integrate the same with Jenkins pipelines using `jenkinsfile`
